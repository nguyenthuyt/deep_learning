# Deep Learning Neural Network

The purpose of this challenge is to build a neural network to predict which of Alphabet Soup's startup investments will be most financially successful. You will compile a neural network model and test different parameters to determine the values that generate the most accurate model. You will then use the optimization techniques to enhance your data preprocessing and model design.

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a software library designed for open source data analysis and manipulation
* tensorflow
* pathlib
* sklearn - train_test_split
* sklearn - StandardScaler
* sklearn - OneHotEncoder
